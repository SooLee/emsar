3. Version history
# This version uses nomenclature FPKM rather than FVKM. (version 1.0)
# This version fixed some memory leaks in reading paired-end bam file. (version 1.0)
# This version removes polyA from fasta file by default and provides an option of retaining polyA. (version 1.0)
# This version fixed a bug in a newly introduced error handling code that stops in a rare case of internal repeats when it is not actually an error. (v0.9.8d)
# This version fixed a critical bug of clashing rshsize++ with paired-end parallelization which may result in discrepancy between actual number of cid's and calculated cid's and cause segmentation fault and/or incorrect estimation. (v0.9.8c)
# This version handles set size=1 separately in a simple way, to save time. (v0.9.8b)
# This version checks bowtie output format. (v0.9.8b)
# This version handles the error caused by reallocation of sfa_s for the size zero case. (v0.9.8b)
# This version checks the number of iterations for MLE and performs reinitialization in case the the number of interation is larger than a certain threshold (set to 10000) to prevent 'hanging.' (v0.9.8b)
# This version set the default -r value to be 1E-15, instead of 1E-3, to avoid a spurious bimodal distribution of logFPKM. (v0.9.8)
# This version reads fasta file twice, the first to compute the size of the sequence array and number of transcripts and the second to store information. This approach avoids reallocation of large arrays which may sometimes fail and cause segmentation fault at a later step. Likewise, the initial tagged suffix array size was doubled to avoid reallocation. Also, it produces an error message when there is a problem with memory allocation. (v0.9.8)
# This version automatically adjust EUMA cut in case a set size goes beyond 5000 (eg. very short reads on the latest human transcriptome) (v0.9.7c)
# This version can handle various library strand types including unstranded, forward-stranded and reverse-stranded. (v0.9.7b)
# This version can handle SAM/BAM file formats for PE data. (v0.9.7b)
# Several memory problems are now fixed in this version. (v0.9.6)
# This version can handle SAM/BAM file formats for SE data. (v0.9.6)
# This version uses different methods of computing fragment length sampling probability, either exact computation (-H) or using observed distribution (by default). (v0.9.6)
# A problem with Casava 1.8 or newer version of fastq headers in PE is now fixed. (v0.9.6)
# This version has a better verbosity control. (v0.8.9)
# This version produces an optional .segments output file instead of .segments.indexed and the first line is deleted, to that it is a plain tab-delimited file. (v0.8.9)
# This version uses a more efficient algorithm for the PE version. (v0.8.9)
# This version fixed some minor memory problems and added TPM estimated in the output. (v0.8.2)
# This version can handle PE. (v0.8.1)
# This version also handles memory more cleanly. (v0.8)
# This version can handle SE variable-length read data. (v0.8)
# This version can stream bowtie output file. (v0.8)
# This version can deal with internal repeat sequences more effectively. (v0.8)
# This version merged EMSARpre_se and EMSAR_se into a single C program. auto_EMSAR_SE.pl is no longer needed. No index table is generated. A segment.indexed file is generated which is similar to the previous aEUMA.indexed file, when option -g is used. It is just for the user's information. (v0.8)
# This version fixed a serious bug that was newly introduced in v0.7.3. (v0.7.4)
# This version no longer supports option -a or --sd_cut. (v0.7.3)
# This version has a progress bar for MLE. (v0.7.3)
# finalize.pl is no longer used and all the final information is printed to fvkm file, including effective transcript length and inferred read counts. (v0.7.3)
# From v0.7.2, fvkm and finalout files do not include combination cid's unless specified by user with option -a.
# From v0.7.2, aEUMA.indexed file format has changed.
# This version generates index table to the output directory. (v0.7.2)
# This version handles memory more cleanly. It dropped EUMAcut option and by default recommend all FVKM values. (v0.7.2)
# This version uses less memory for suffix arrays, by using incremental reallocation strategy. (v0.7.1)
# This version has a modified EMSARpre_se that directly reads from a fasta file, either single or multi-line, without the need of `indexify.pl` (v0.7)
# This version has a modified `indexify.pl` which deals with raw fasta file that did not go through `fm2s.3`. (v0.7)
# This version has multi-threading implemented for EMSARse. (v0.7)
# This version has no limit for the number of threads for EMSARpre_se. (v0.7)
# This version has sdcut 0.1 and mm 2 as default. (v0.6.1)
# This version removed the --cut option from auto_EMSAR_se.pl and fixed parameter setting for EMSAR_se. (v0.6)
# This version currently handles only single-end (strand-specific & non-strand-specific) fixed-length case. (v.0.1)
